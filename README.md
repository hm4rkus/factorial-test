## How to execute

1. Go to the `/back` folders and execute `yarn / npm install`.
2. Create an `.env` file with the variables I sent you by email to the `/back` folder.
3. Run the backend executing `yarn run start / npm run start` inside the `/back` folder.
4. Install `serve` globally, if you do not have it already.
5. Run the frontend executing `serve -s build`.
